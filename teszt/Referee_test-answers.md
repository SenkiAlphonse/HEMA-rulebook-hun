1. One of the fencers starts a compound attack with a feint. The opponent does not react to the feint, and starts a counterattack while staying in place, after the fencer’s final attack has started. He hits the fencer’s hand a bit sooner than the attack hits him, with a quick move of the arms. The attack has been correctly carried out. What is the call?
    1. Point for the attack.
1. One of the fencers has a brilliant plan that would result in a spectacular, historically epic technique if successful. The referee anticipates this, and approves completely, this is what he himself would do in the same situation! However, due to just a little technical mistake in his footwork, falls on the opponent's blade, as if parried. The opponent immediately and faultlessly ripostes, while the fencer pulls off a historically correct move regardless of the humble parry-riposte received somewhere along the line. This makes the referee sad on multiple levels. What is the call? 
Point for riposte
1. One of the fencers has a brilliant plan that would result in a spectacular, historically epic technique if successful. The referee anticipates this, and approves completely, this is what he himself would do in the same situation! However, due to just a little technical mistake, the fencer lunges too soon, does not really hit with their first move. The opponent immediately and faultlessly initiates his own attack, while the fencer renews attack and pulls off a historically correct move regardless of the fall-short somewhere along the line. The referee has been waiting his whole life to see this very action in a live bout. What is the call? 
Point for riposte after the fall-short.
1. One of the fencers has a brilliant plan that would result in a spectacular, historically epic technique if successful. The referee anticipates this, and approves completely, this is what he himself would do in the same situation! However, the fencer receives a stop hit just on the successful side of a stop hit in time :( The fencer continues his attack and pulls off a historically correct move, regardless of the stop hit in time somewhere along the line. The referee is the fencer’s own coach at home. What is the call? 
Point for the stop hi… ok who are we kidding, srsly. The fencer’s own coach should not referee the bout if possible.

1. A fencer attacks with a weapon held in one hand, the opponent disregards this attack, and counterattacks also with a weapon held in one hand, resulting in a double hit. What is the call?

    1. Simultaneous hit, point both
1. A fencer attacks with a weapon held in one hand, the opponent moves to parry in reaction, but remembers that one handed hits are inferior to two handed ones, and diverts to riposte. The result is a double hit. What is the call?
    1. Point for attack because of bad parry
1. A fencer starts an attack with a faultless step-lunge. The opponent retreats a step, and starts an attack with lunge at the same time the fencer’s step is ending. Both attacks hit. What’s the call?
    1. Simultaneous hit. (CHANGES!!!)
1. A fencer starts an attack with a faultless step-lunge. The opponent does not react initially, and starts an attack with lunge at the same time the fencer’s step is ending. Both attacks hit. What’s the call?
    1. Simultaneous hit (CHANGES!!!)
    1. Treat any ensuing injuries.
1. A fencer starts an attack with a step-lunge. As he starts the lunge, he pulls his hands back and upwards, then hits with a circular motion. The opponent does not react initially, and starts an attack at the same time the fencer’s step is ending. Both hit. What’s the call?

When your head takes a hit — as often happens in contact sports — your brain shifts or shakes around inside the skull. The impact damages your brain cells, causing chemical and cellular changes in the brain.

1. What does ‘refereeing consistency within the bout’ mean?
    1. The referee may make a little mistake in judgments, while directing the first part of the bout.

The referee can change his approach in the next bout.”
