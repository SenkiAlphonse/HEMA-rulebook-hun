45. One of the fencers has a brilliant plan that would result in a spectacular, historically epic technique if successful. The referee anticipates this, and approves completely, this is what he himself would do in the same situation! However, due to just a little technical mistake in his footwork, falls on the opponent's blade, as if parried.

The impact damages your brain cells, causing chemical and cellular changes in the brain.
